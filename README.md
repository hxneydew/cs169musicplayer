online music player that switches between two EPs: Songs of by The Story So Far and Transit by Decorator. This project was the practice coding the functionality of buttons commonly found on a music player (play/pause, next, previous, seek, etc) as well as changing CSS based on onclick events. 

all music rights belong to the creators and owners of the songs. i have no ownership of these songs, as they were chosen to be used for demonstration (as well as sharing songs and bands i love). pls dont sue me.

mad shoutout to some other music player projects i've seen that provided a lot of inspiration and help for how i wanted to accomplish this.
